HyperFlex Edge Policy Maker for Cisco Intersight Script on dCloud (All Flash/Hybrid, 2-Node), v1.0
Author: Ugo Emekauwa
Contact: uemekauw@cisco.com, uemekauwa@gmail.com
Summary: The HyperFlex Edge Policy Maker script automates the creation of sample HyperFlex policies in Intersight that can be used to deploy a HyperFlex Edge cluster.
Notes: Tested on Intersight API Reference v1.0.9-1229

  <b>ISSUE:</b> Please be advised that on %(date)s, the Intersight service account named %(intersight_account_name)s did not pass the availability test for session ID #%(intersight_account_session)s located in %(intersight_account_location)s. Please directly check the Intersight service account at https://intersight.com to verify the account status and that all permitted users are present. See the attached session.xml and cluster.xml files for additional details on the demo session and Intersight service account.
  <br><br>

  <b>RESOLUTION:</b> Verify that the HyperFlex Edge cluster was actually assigned to the demo session, as the Intersight service account will not be assigned without a matching cluster. If the service account type, name, email, cluster and location in the above summary are blank, than likely an oversubscription of resources has occured on the dCloud platform. Other causes may be that an Intersight cloud service is down. Visit https://status.intersight.com to check the status of Intersight cloud services.
